## Simple Cipher

### Understanding
- A letter modified according to the Caesar cipher is it's alpha position + 3
  + `String#ord` for a single character
  + `String#codepoints` for multiple characters
    1. Get codepoints
    2. Map to add 3
    3. Map again to get back to the alpha character (`Integer#chr`)
    4. Join
- I don't understand the concept of a 'key' that the description is presenting
  + If there are multiple of the same letter, is the output just one 'shift' at that letter?
  + Do you perform the shift as many times as the letter is presented?
    * Use my preliminary `encode` method in irb to do the shift x times
  + I finally figured it out:
    * The intent is that a random letter is taken from the possible inputs from the key.
  + ^ wasn't right either
    * Every letter in the key represents the shift distance for corresponding letters in the input text

### Task
- Implement a simple shift cipher like Caesar and a more secure substitution cipher.

Step 1:

"If he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, that is, by so changing the order of the letters of the alphabet, that not a word could be made out. If anyone wishes to decipher these, and get at their meaning, he must substitute the fourth letter of the alphabet, namely D, for A, and so with the others."

â€” Suetonius, Life of Julius Caesar

Ciphers are very straight-forward algorithms that allow us to render text less readable while still allowing easy deciphering. They are vulnerable to many forms of cryptoanalysis, but we are lucky that generally our little sisters are not cryptoanalysts.

The Caeser Cipher was used for some messages from Julius Caesar that were sent afield. Now Caeser knew that the cipher wasn't very good, but he had one ally in that respect: almost nobody could read well. So even being a couple letters off was sufficient so that people couldn't recognize the few words that they did know.

Your task is to create a simple shift cipher like the Caesar Cipher. This image is a great example of the Caesar Cipher:

Caesar Cipher

Here are some examples:
```
@cipher = Cipher.new
@cipher.encode("iamapandabear") #=> "ldpdsdqgdehdu"
@cipher.decode("ldpdsdqgdehdu") #=> "iamapandabear"
```

Step 2:

Shift ciphers are no fun though when your kid sister figures it out. Try amending the code to allow us to specify a key and use that for the shift distance. This is called a substitution cipher.

Here's an example:
```
@cipher = Cipher.new("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa")
@cipher.encode("iamapandabear") #=> "iamapandabear"
@cipher = Cipher.new("ddddddddddddddddd")
@cipher.encode("imapandabear") #=> "lpdsdqgdehdu"
```

In the example above, we've set a = 0 for the key value. So when the plaintext is added to the key, we end up with the same message coming out. So "aaaa" is not an ideal key. But if we set the key to "dddd", we would get the same thing as the Caesar Cipher.

Step 3:

The weakest link in any cipher is the human being. Let's make your substitution cipher a little more fault tolerant by providing a source of randomness and ensuring that they key is not composed of numbers or capital letters.

If someone doesn't submit a key at all, generate a truly random key of at least 100 characters in length, accessible via Cipher#key (the # syntax means instance variable)

If the key submitted has capital letters or numbers, throw an ArgumentError with a message to that effect.

Some examples:

```
@cipher = Cipher.new
@cipher.key #=> "duxrceqyaimciuucnelkeoxjhdyduucpmrxmaivacmybmsdrzwqxvbxsygzsabdjmdjabeorttiwinfrpmpogvabiofqexnohrqu"
```

### Implementation
- `SubstitutionCipherTest`
  + Get the codepoints for the text
  + Get the codepoints for the key
  + Iterate simultaneously and transform the text per corresponding key
  + Refactor
    * Make the `#encode` and `#decode` less redundant
    * The only difference between encoding and decoding is the operator (i.e. adding or subtracting the offset)
    * I can make `#encode` decode by flopping the operator
      - Pass in the desired operator
  + `#test_double_shift_encode`
    * Looks like there should be some exceptions regarding functionality
    * Some letters go out of bounds when being shifted by themselves
    * One solution would be to use a custom numbering system
      - Map letters to new 'codepoints'
  + `#test_cipher_encode_wrap`
