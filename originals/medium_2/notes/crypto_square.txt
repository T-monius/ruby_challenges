Understanding
  - Square code = method for composing secret messages
  - Input
    + English text
  - Task
    + Normalize text
      > remove spaces and punctuation
      > downcase
    + Characters
      > Break into rows
        = 8 characters
      > Print with intervening newlines
    + Rectangle
      > Rows aligned to form columns
      > Matching row indexes stored as a 'column' sequentially
    + Square sizing
      > Per Message length
      > Perfect square?
        = (4, 9, 16, 25, 36)
        = Square root is a whole number
      > Not perfect square
        = Smallest square larger than the number of characters
          in the message
        = Square root plus a character
  - Output
    + Encoded English text
    + Array of string elements

  - Test suite decodes also

Approach
  - Have all functionality but some exceptions
    + The basic rule for row length is that if it's a perfect
      square then use the row lentgth equivalent to the square
      root of the length
    + Not a perfect square
      = Use square root plus one if that resulting block is
        greater in number of rows than the number of characters in each segment
      = Use square root plus two if adding one resulted in a
        square that had more characters in each segment than
        characters in rows
