Understanding
  - RLE
    + data compression
    + Replace runs of data elements with one and count
    + Count placed before the data element
  - Input
    + String
  - Task
    + Parse the string by characters
    + Count the portions taken of each character
  - Output
    + String
    + Count of each character followed by the character
  - `#encode` and `#decode`

  - `#decode`
    + Input
    + Count of how many of the following character to print
      > Can use Regex to parse
      > Any number of digit characters followed by a single
        unicode character

Implementation
  - `#encode`
  - Iterate over the input string
    + Take the characters from the front of the string while
      they are equal to the first character in the string
      > Do this destructively
      > Push to an array of the consecutive elements
    + Iterate the array of consecutive elements
      > Get a count
      > Store the count of the inner array as lead of string
      > As suffix of string, the character
      > Push to a return string
    + Return the encoded string
  - `#decode`
    + Iterate the array of the count/char combinations
      > Push the char count times to the return string
      > Return the string
